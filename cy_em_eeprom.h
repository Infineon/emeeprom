 * \addtogroup group_emeeprom Em_EEPROM Middleware Library
 * \{
 * The Emulated EEPROM (Em_EEPROM) middleware emulates an EEPROM storage in
 * the MCU's non volatile memory and it is built on top of a block storage
 * devie that abstracts the underlying memory architecture so that the middleware
 * is portable to a wide range of devices.
 *
 * Use the Em_EEPROM to store non-volatile data on a target device when
 * increasing flash memory endurance and restoring corrupted data from
 * a redundant copy is required.
 *
 * <b>Features:</b>
 * * EEPROM-Like Non-Volatile Storage
 * * Easy to use Read and Write
 * * Optional Wear Leveling
 * * Optional Redundant Data Storage
 *
 ********************************************************************************

 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * Include cy_em_eeprom.h to get access to all functions and other declarations
 * in this library. See the \ref section_em_eeprom_quick_start to start using
 * the Em_EEPROM.
 *
 * Refer to the \ref section_em_eeprom_toolchain section for compatibility
 * information.
 *
 * Refer to the \ref section_em_eeprom_changelog section for differences
 * between Em_EEPROM versions. The \ref section_em_eeprom_changelog section
 * also describes the impact of the changes to your code.
 *
 * Em_EEPROM operates on the top of the block storage solution.
 * Refer to the block storage asset documentation for more information.
 * Also, refer to the \ref section_em_eeprom_miscellaneous section for
 * the different Em_EEPROM middleware restrictions and limitations.
 *
 * The Em_EEPROM middleware can operate in various modes:
 * * with or without wear leveling - depending on whether you want to increase
 *   the endurance of the nvm memory.
 * * with or without a redundant copy - depending on how critical for you is
 *   the ability to recover information.
 * * to save nvm and work via Em_EEPROM APIs similar to the nvm APIs.
 *   But, in this case, recovering your data and monitoring the endurance
 *   is impossible.
 *
 * There are several use cases depending on where you store your Em_EEPROM data:
 * * in the application flash
 * * in the auxiliary flash
 * * in the application flash at a fixed address.
 *
 * Note: refer to device capabilities for supported storage location for
 * EM_EEPROM data.
 *
 * The \ref section_em_eeprom_configuration_considerations section provides
 * the guidance for all these operation modes and use cases.
 * You may also want to migrate from PSoC Creator to ModusToolbox
 * or other environment to simply use the Em_EEPROM middleware APIs.
 * Refer to the \ref section_em_eeprom_migration section.
 *
 * The \ref section_em_eeprom_quick_start section highlights the use case,
 * when the Em_EEPROM data is located in the application flash, and the
 * Em_EEPROM is configured to increase the flash endurance
 * (the wearLevelingFactor parameter is turned on).

 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * XMC7xxx and T2G-B-H based devices support Em_EEPROM Data only in "Work Flash".
 * The "Work Flash" provides sectors with 2 sizes namely: Large (2 kbytes) and
 * Small (128 bytes). The user should select which type of Work FLash region
 * will be used for Em_EEPROM storage specifying the start address in the config
 * structure.
 *
 * Using EEPROM Personality:
 * The EEPROM personality has checkbox for:
 * "Work Flash Sector Selection default Small Sector"
 * which is "checked" by default. To use Large sector work flash, uncheck this box.
 *
 ********************************************************************************
 * \section section_em_eeprom_quick_start Quick Start Guide
 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * Em_EEPROM middleware can be used in various Development
 * Environments such as ModusToolbox, Mbed OS, etc. Refer to the
 * \ref section_em_eeprom_toolchain section.
 *
 * The below steps describe the simplest way of enabling the Em_EEPROM
 * middleware with placing EEPROM memory into the application flash.
 *
 * 1. Open/Create an application where to add the Em_EEPROM function.
 *
 * 2. Add the Em_EEPROM middleware to your project.
 *    This quick start guide assumes that the environment is configured
 *    to use the Peripheral Driver Library (mtb-pdl-cat1 or mtb-pdl-cat2)
 *    and the Hardware Abstraction Layer (mtb-hal-cat1)
 *    for development and the Peripheral Driver Library is included in
 *    the project. If you are using the ModusToolbox development environment
 *    select the application in the Project Explorer window and navigate to
 *    the Project/ModusToolbox Library Manager menu. A window appears,
 *    check the Emulated EEPROM middleware and click the OK button.
 *
 * 3. Include Em_EEPROM in the main.c file:
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_required_includes
 *
 * 4. Define the Em_EEPROM configuration as follow:
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_configuration_data
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_configuration_simple
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_configuration_wear
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_configuration_redundant
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_configuration_blocking
 *    Refer to the \ref cy_stc_eeprom_config_t  or \ref cy_stc_eeprom_config2_t
 *    structure for details of other configuration options.
 *
 * 5. Declare the Em_EEPROM storage variable (further Em_EEPROM Storage)
 *    in the application nvm:
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_application_storage_placing
 *    The allocated memory must be initialized by zeros, and aligned to the
 *    whole row size CY_EM_EEPROM_FLASH_SIZEOF_ROW for Flash based products,
 *    otherwise the Em_EEPROM middleware behavior will be unexpected.<br>
 *    Refer to the \ref section_em_eeprom_configuration_considerations section
 *    for other options of Em_EEPROM nvm allocation.
 *
 * 6. Allocate memory for the Em_EEPROM context structure:
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_eeprom_context_declaration
 *
 * 7. Allocate memory for the Em_EEPROM configuration structure and
 *    initialize it:
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_eeprom_config_declaration
 *    or
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_eeprom_config2_declaration
 *
 * 8. Initialize the Em_EEPROM middleware once at the start:
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_eeprom_start
 *    or
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_eeprom_start_with_bd_nvm
 *    or
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_eeprom_start_with_bd_cat2
 *    Init function stores in context, the configuration and current state
 *    of EEPROM storage. It is used and updated in subsequent API calls.
 *
 * 9. Now, the Em_EEPROM middleware is ready to use. Call the Write or Read
 *    functions to write or read one byte or Erase to wipe the storage:
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_eeprom_read_write
 *    and
 *    \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_eeprom_erase
 *

 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * This section consists of different guides and instruction of how to enable,
 * configure, and use the Emulated EEPROM Middleware in a design.
 * As you can see from the \ref section_em_eeprom_quick_start section,
 * the settings of the Em_EEPROM middleware are controlled with

 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * The settings of the Em_EEPROM middleware are controlled by

 *
 ********************************************************************************
 * \subsubsection section_em_eeprom_mode_wearleveling Wear Leveling
 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * Depending on whether you want to increase the flash memory endurance
 * or not, enable or disable the wear leveling.
 * The higher the value is, the more flash is used, but a higher number of
 * erase/write cycles can be done on Em_EEPROM.
 * Multiply this number by the datasheet write endurance spec to determine
 * the max of write cycles.<br>
 * The amount of wear leveling from 1 to 10. 1 means no wear leveling is used.
 *
 * To configure the wear leveling just set the WEAR_LEVELING macro value from
 * (1u) to (10u) in step #4 in the \ref section_em_eeprom_quick_start section:
 * \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_configuration_wear
 *
 ********************************************************************************
 * \subsubsection section_em_eeprom_mode_redundantcopy Redundant Copy
 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * Depending on how critical for you is recovering information,
 * configure the redundant copy feature.
 * If enabled (1 - enabled, 0 - disabled), a checksum
 * (stored in a row) is calculated on each row of data,
 * while a redundant copy of Em_EEPROM is stored in another location.
 * When data is read, first the checksum is checked. If that checksum is bad,
 * and the redundant copy's checksum is good, the copy is restored.
 *
 * To configure the redundant copy just set the REDUNDANT_COPY macro value to
 * (1u) or (0u) in step #4 in the \ref section_em_eeprom_quick_start section:
 * \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_configuration_redundant
 *
 ********************************************************************************
 * \subsubsection section_em_eeprom_mode_simple Simple Mode
 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * Simple mode, when enabled (1 - enabled, 0 - disabled), means no
 * additional service information is stored by the Em_EEPROM middleware
 * like checksums, headers, a number of writes, etc.
 * Data is stored directly by the specified address.
 * The size of Em_EEPROM storage is equal to the number of
 * byte specified in the eepromSize parameter rounded up to a full row
 * size CY_EM_EEPROM_FLASH_SIZEOF_ROW. The wear leveling and
 * redundant copy features are disabled, i.e. wearLevelingFactor and
 * redundantCopy parameters are ignored.
 *
 * To configure Simple mode just set the SIMPLE_MODE macro value
 * to (1u) or (0u) in step #4 in the \ref section_em_eeprom_quick_start section:
 * \snippet emeeprom/sut/main.c snippet_configuration_simple
 *
 ********************************************************************************
 * \subsection section_em_eeprom_location Em_EEPROM Storage Variable Location and Size
 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * The user is responsible for allocating space in flash for Em_EEPROM
 * (further the Em_EEPROM storage).
 *
 * For PSoC 6 the Em_EEPROM storage can be placed:
 * * in the application flash
 * * in the auxiliary flash.
 *
 * Additionally, the storage can be placed at a fixed address in the
 * application flash.
 *
 * For PSoC 4 the Em_EEPROM storage can be placed:
 * * in the application flash
 *
 * Additionally, the storage can be placed at a fixed address in the
 * application flash.
 *
 * For XMC7xxx and T2G-B-H the Em_EEPROM storage can be placed:
 * * in the Work Flash region
 *
 * The storage location must be aligned to CY_EM_EEPROM_FLASH_SIZEOF_ROW.
 *
 * The storage size depends on other configuration parameters and is calculated
 * using the following equation:
 *
 * 1. Simple mode is turned on. It means the direct mapping of the user data
 *    in the Em_EEPROM storage:
 *
 *    <i>storageSize = eepromSize</i>
 *
 *    where:<br>
 *    <i>eepromSize</i> the number of bytes to store in the Em_EEPROM storage
 *    rounded up to a full row size CY_EM_EEPROM_FLASH_SIZEOF_ROW.
 *    The row size is specific for a device family. Refer to the specific
 *    PSoC device datasheet.
 *
 * 2. Simple mode is turned off. It means the Em_EEPROM middleware stores
 *    service information about number of writes, checksums, etc.
 *
 *    <i>storageSize = eepromSize * 2 * wearLevelingFactor * (1 + redundantCopy)</i>
 *
 *    where:<br>
 *    <i>eepromSize</i> the number of bytes to store in the Em_EEPROM storage
 *    rounded up to the half of a row size (CY_EM_EEPROM_FLASH_SIZEOF_ROW / 2u).
 *    The row size is specific for a device family. Refer to the specific
 *    PSoC device datasheet.
 *
 * Use the CY_EM_EEPROM_GET_PHYSICAL_SIZE() macro to get the needed
 * storage size depending on the configuration.
 *
 ********************************************************************************
 * \subsubsection section_em_eeprom_appsflash_location Em_EEPROM Location in the application flash
 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * The below example shows placing the Em_EEPROM storage in the application
 * flash for GCC, ARMCC, and IAR compilers:
 *
 *    \code
 *      CY_ALIGN(CY_EM_EEPROM_FLASH_SIZEOF_ROW)
 *      const uint8_t emEepromStorage[STORAGE_SIZE] = {0u};
 *    \endcode
 *
 * where STORAGE_SIZE is the size of the Em_EEPROM storage. Refer to the
 * \ref section_em_eeprom_location section for size calculation equations.
 * For convenience, use the CY_EM_EEPROM_GET_PHYSICAL_SIZE macro to
 * get the needed Em_EEPROM storage size depending on the configuration.
 *
 ********************************************************************************
 * \subsubsection section_em_eeprom_auxflash_location Em_EEPROM Location in the auxiliary flash
 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * Writes to rows affect the endurance of other rows in the same sector.
 * We recommend using the auxiliary flash for frequently-updated data.
 * The below example shows placing the Em_EEPROM storage in the
 * auxiliary flash (section .cy_em_eeprom) for GCC, ARMCC, and IAR compilers.
 *
 *    \code
 *      CY_SECTION(".cy_em_eeprom")
 *      CY_ALIGN(CY_EM_EEPROM_FLASH_SIZEOF_ROW)
 *      const uint8_t emEepromStorage[STORAGE_SIZE] = {0u};
 *    \endcode
 *
 * where STORAGE_SIZE is the size of the storage. Refer to the
 * \ref section_em_eeprom_location section for size calculation equations.
 * For convenience, use the CY_EM_EEPROM_GET_PHYSICAL_SIZE macro to
 * get the needed Em_EEPROM storage size depending on the configuration.
 *
 ********************************************************************************
 * \subsection section_em_eeprom_appsflash_fixed Em_EEPROM Location in the application flash at a
 * fixed address
 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * To allocate the Em_EEPROM storage at a fixed address in
 * the application flash, modify the linker control file (linker script).
 * This requires fundamental knowledge of the linker
 * control file, because there is a risk of receiving a linker error while
 * building the project if you make some improper modifications.
 *
 * This approach demonstrates adding the storage reservation in the application
 * flash after the application. You must calculate the application end
 * address and select the address of the Em_EEPROM storage so that the
 * memory spaces of the storage and the application do not overlap.
 * You might also add some offset between the application end address
 * and the Em_EEPROM storage start address to ensure
 * there is extra space in case the project code grows.

 ********************************************************************************
 * \subsection section_em_eeprom_miscellaneous Limitations and Restrictions
 ********************************************************************************
 *
 * * The Em_EEPROM storage location must be initialized with zeros and
 *   aligned to the flash row size referred to in the specific PSoC device
 *   datasheet otherwise the Em_EEPROM behavior may be unexpected.
 *   For convenience, CY_EM_EEPROM_FLASH_SIZEOF_ROW is provided.
 *
 * * The Em_EEPROM storage size depends on the configuration. Refer to the
 *   \ref section_em_eeprom_location section for size calculation equations.
 *   For convenience, the CY_EM_EEPROM_GET_PHYSICAL_SIZE macro is provided.
 *
 * * Do not modify the Em_EEPROM context structure \ref cy_stc_eeprom_context_t
 *   since it may cause unexpected behavior of the Cy_Em_EEPROM functions
 *   that rely on this context structure.
 *
 * * The Internal memory address map, flash organization, size of rows, etc.
 *   is specific for each device family. Refer to the specific device datasheet
 *   for the details.
 *
 * * The Read-While-Write (RWW) feature available in PSoC 6 MCU allows you
 *   to write to flash while executing the code from flash. There are restrictions
 *   on using this feature for EEPROM emulation. There are also multiple
 *   constraints for blocking and nonblocking flash operations, relating to
 *   interrupts, Power mode, IPC usage, etc.
 *   Refer to the "Flash (Flash System Routine)" section of the CAT1
 *   Peripheral Driver Library (mtb-pdl-cat1) API Reference Manual.<br>
 *
 * * Manage auxiliary flash space for both cores of PSoC 6. For PSoC 6,
 *   by default, the compiler always assigns both cores with full range
 *   of auxiliary flash (0x14000000-0x14008000) for EM_EEPROM. Both
 *   cores operate on the same flash object. A building error would occur
 *   if there is an out-sync operation on the memory range from any single
 *   core. If more than one driver and/or middleware occupying the auxiliary
 *   flash is simultaneously under used, for example, Bluetooth Low Energy
 *   (BLE) and Em_EEPROM, a building error will occur while generating the
 *   elf file. The error occurs because there is an auxiliary flash region
 *   allocated for BLE to store the Bonding list, and this region will only
 *   be allocated to the core where the BLE host lies. This out-sync between
 *   the two cores causes the building failure. For details of how to manage
 *   the auxiliary flash for both cores properly refer to
 *   the <a href="https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-15264">
 *   <b>Manage Flash Space for Both Cores of PSoC 6 - KBA224173</b></a>
 *
 * * Writing of multiple rows by single the Cy_Em_EEPROM_Write() function
 *   may lead to the following behavior:
 *   The first row is written, then the device is reset due to power down or other
 *   reasons, then the device is powered up again. This leads to data integrity
 *   loss: i.e. the first row contains new data while the rest of the rows contain
 *   old data and Em_EEPROM will not be able to detect the issue since
 *   the row checksum is valid.

 *   The Em_EEPROM component provides Em_EEPROM storage located in the
 *   auxiliary flash. The Em_EEPROM middleware requires the storage
 *   to be provided by the application program.
 *   Therefore, place the below code into your application program.
 *     \code
 *       CY_SECTION(".cy_em_eeprom")
 *       CY_ALIGN(CY_EM_EEPROM_FLASH_SIZEOF_ROW)
 *       const uint8_t emEepromStorage[STORAGE_SIZE] = {0u};
 *     \endcode
 *   where STORAGE_SIZE is the size of the storage that can be seen in
 *   the Em_EEPROM component customizer as "Actual EEPROM size (bytes)".<br>
 *   For convenience, use the CY_EM_EEPROM_GET_PHYSICAL_SIZE macro to
 *   get the needed Em_EEPROM storage size depending on the configuration.
